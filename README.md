# wd-Javascript-React-basic

This project is a basic proof of concept for a React application. The goal is to test basic functionality and ensure that all necessary components and libraries are properly integrated and functioning as expected.

The application will include a simple user interface with a few interactive elements, such as buttons and forms. These elements will be used to demonstrate the ability to handle user input and update the state of the application.

Additionally, the project will include basic routing using React Router to navigate between different parts of the application.
